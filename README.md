# Python-API-Challenge
# Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
# Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list
# Compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude).
# Create linear regression graph
